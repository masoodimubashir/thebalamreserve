                        <p>Hosted at the Balam Reserve in Belize, students will be selected from the prestigious
                            Conrad Challenge, a global competition focused on innovation, education, and
                            entrepreneurship. The participating students will be divided into working groups and
                            commit to continue their efforts for a period of one year. An online platform will
                            engage subject matter experts, host workshops and learning sessions to assist students
                            in addressing the NET Zero Challenge. At the end of the year, student solutions
                            portfolios will be evaluated by experts utilizing a robust rubric to establish the
                            feasibility and viability of their innovations. Top students will be invited to present their
                            innovative solutions to the partnering universities. They will also be invited to the
                            Balam Reserve Innovation Lab class for the following year and collaborate with
                            incoming students on their innovations.</p>
